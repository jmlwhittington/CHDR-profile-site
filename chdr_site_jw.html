            <p>
            Hello! My name is Justin Whittington, but I tend to publish/present under J. M. L. (Justin Michael Lee) because my name isn't as uncommon as I'd prefer and I like the more gender neutral presentation.
            </p>
            <p>
            Alongside being a graduate research associate here at the Center for Humanities and Digital Research, I'm a first-year student in the Texts and Technology PhD program, where I describe my work as on "sociopolitical phenomena of games and theme parks." It doesn't hurt that I also love partaking in those outside of academia.
            </p>
            <p>
            I was born, raised, and spent the first thirty-one years of my life in West Virginia (hence this page's themes, our state colors). The various impacts this has had on me is something I didn't realize until I moved here to Florida.
            </p>
            <p>
            There's quite a bit more about me at my <a href="https://jmlwhittington.com/">personal website</a>, if you care to know more. You can also email me for any reason: <a href="mailto:jmlwhittington@ucf.edu">jmlwhittington@ucf.edu</a>. I'll gladly respond (and talk your ear off if given the chance)!
